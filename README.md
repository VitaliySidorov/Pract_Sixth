**Task 41:** The user enters M numbers from the keyboard. Count how many numbers greater than 0 the user entered.
</br>0, 7, 8, -2, -2 -> 2
</br>1, -7, 567, 89, 223->4

**Problem 43:** Write a program that will find the point of intersection of two lines </br>given by the equations y = k1 * x + b1, y = k2 * x + b2; the values b1, k1, b2 and k2 are set by the user.
</br>b1 = 2, k1 = 5, b2 = 4, k2 = 9 -> (-0.5; -0.5)
